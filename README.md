# Hello guys

My name is Matthew and I'm just your average autistic gamer with a questionable sense of humor. You can find me on certain social media platforms such as Twitter, Bluesky, Discord, Instagram and YouTube. Just search up TrueCloud6 or TrueCloud648 and you'll probably find me. 

# My Community

I'm active in a small community that is mainly filled with individuals who have a passion for games and art. I'm a beginner digital artist and 3D artist who is trying to improve as time goes on. I hope to pursue something related to art in the future, whether it is animating, drawing, modeling, etc.
